                                    After 10th , a student can choose one of the three main streams i.e.
                                    Science, Commerce and Humanities/Arts. Each of these streams have
                                    different future prospects and career options. If you are a student
                                    who has just completed class 10th, then it is imperative to get yourself
                                    acquainted with the scope of all the major streams and define your career
                                    path right from the beginning. Imagine selecting a stream without prior
                                    knowledge of its scope only to regret later and pursue a career you dislike!
                                    This is a common occurrence in real life! This has taken place with a lot of
                                    students who just went with any stream and landed into an undesirable career
                                    field. Not only does CareerBuilder’s counsellor give you valuable advice, but
                                    also provide enough information to let you choose the right career for you.

                                    class 10th often get influenced by what their peers say. Hence, to make

                                    he/she must look out for a good career guidance program.

                                    As you are at the junction of which stream to choose and whose advice you should follow,
                                    we at CareerBuilder would suggest that you listen to no one.
                                    <br />
                                    You heard that right. Our career counsellors always tell students to have a practical
                                    approach towards making career choices. The practical advice they give is:
                                    <br />
                                    Get yourself aware about the scope of all three streams
                                    Analyse what really matters to you in all the above three
                                    Choose what suits best for you<br />
                                    Take a decision<br />
                                    A career counsellor does not force you to take decisions. In fact counselling is entirely
                                    the opposite of this. A career counsellor makes sure whatever you decide or choose, you
                                    are absolutely aware of its scope and the opportunities. Therefore, all the streams have
                                    futuristic scope if pursued with utmost passion. All you have to do is choose the one that
                                    suits your capabilities. And this understanding is vital for class 9th and 10th students.
