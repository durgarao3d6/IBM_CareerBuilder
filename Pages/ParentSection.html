                                <strong>Aptitude: </strong>
                                The child aptitude is a mirror of his personality, strengths, and weaknesses.
                                Hence, a strategically designed aptitude test can reveal a lot of information
                                regarding the student that can help in taking a well-informed career selection.

                                It is very difficult to spend your life working in a field that you are not
                                interested in. Hence, the parent should look into the interests of their child
                                and consider it while shortlisting career options.

                                <strong>Availability of the Course: </strong>
                                The courses leading towards a desired career should be
                                available easily in the proximity and should not burden the student.

                                <strong>Informed Decision over Herd Mentality: </strong>
                                It is very easy for a child to get swayed by peer pressure into choosing a
                                career that the majority is opting rather than the one which is best for
                                him/her. Sometimes, even the parents get attracted to a career choice that
                                is trending and this ends up hampering the students performance. Hence,
                                a parent needs to be informed about all the career choices and chose the ones
                                that are best for their child.

                                pursuing a particular course. The larger the scope, the better are the chances of finding
                                the role that suits the child most.

                                Nobody likes to earn peanuts. The remuneration should match the child’s aspirations and
                                should enable a satisfied and comfortable life.

                        </ul>
                        <h3>Solution?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The role of parents in career selection is crucial for both the parents as well as the students.
                            The stress among children multiplies when they feel the void of guidance. Children feel the need to
                            express and at times parents can’t understand this need, this increases the gap between a parent and
                            the child. Thus parents play a key role in the entire process.<br />

                            Providing your children with an atmosphere that motivates them to express better and listening with
                            patience is the key to solving this issue. The child may be wrong but as a parent, it’s your responsibility
                            to reason with them rather than getting angry. Children are impulsive by nature. Keeping a track of your
                            child’s changing interests and recommend career options that match their interests. Thus it is important
                            for you as parents to realize your role of parents in your child’s development.<br />

                            Demotivation might have a negative impact on the child’s mental health and hence rather than rejecting all
                            the ideas of the child, you can work together in gathering information regarding the career choice and then
                            help the child in deciding whether it is suitable or not.
